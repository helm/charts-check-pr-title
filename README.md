# Charts Check PR Title

This little app was designed specifically for the [charts repo](https://github.com/helm/charts).
It asks people to put their pull request titles in a certain format if they didn't
already do it. It's a little helper for chart maintainers.

The app is owned and managed by the charts maintainers.
